            <h4> Some Info</h4>

                <p>
                When the band broke up in 1987 the tension was high between the members. Marr left right after they released their final album, Strangeways, Here We Come.
                Morrissey, Rourke and Joyce tried to contniue as a 3 man band but soon called it quits. <br> </p></div>

                <p></p>

                <div class = "paragraphTwo"><h4>What happened to the smiths?</h4>
                Morrissey decided to go his own way after the smiths, starting his own solo career. His solo career has been rather successful, releasing 13 albums and he is still going strong to this day.<br>
                Johhny Marr has been a member of a number of bands since he left, now he is just doing tours, singing and playing guitar all over the world <br>
                Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce stayed together, performing with some big singers all around the world. </p></div>
