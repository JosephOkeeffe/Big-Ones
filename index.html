             <p>
            The Smiths were a 4 man rock band, based in Manchester, England. They were formed in 1982. 
            The band only lasted 5 years, breaking up in 1987. Even though the band was short-lived, they most definitely left their mark on the music world. 
            They decided to call themselves <b>"The Smiths"</b> because it was ordinary. Most bands at the time had obscure names and they just wanted to show the world that
             you <em>dont need to be special to make a difference.</em><br>
